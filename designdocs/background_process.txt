So for running of the jobs (which could take a long time) we are using delayed job.

We have a job called ComputationJob inside lib/. In it's "perform" method we need
to fill out the code for grabbing the job from the DB and then processing it via
m2 and other scripts as needed and then updating the job in the DB when it's done.

To kick off the job, we do something like the following:

Delayed::Job.enqueue(ComputationJob.new(params[:id]))
